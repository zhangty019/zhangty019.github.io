I am a **postdoctoral researcher** in the Digital Manufacturing Lab at the University of Manchester (**UoM**). I earned my PhD degree from the same group at the UoM, supervised by [Prof. Charlie C. L. Wang](https://mewangcl.github.io/) and [Dr. Zekai Murat Kilic](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/zekaimurat.kilic). My Master’s degree is from [Prof. Wanhua Zhao](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/whzhao)'s Machine Tool  Research Group at Xi’an Jiaotong University (**XJTU**) and further had 1 year of industry experience at Shenzhen Inovance Technology. I received my ​B.Eng. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (**UESTC**).

My main research topic is **Multi-axis Advance Manufacturing**. As a researcher in the field of advanced manufacturing, I've developed a computational pipeline to support additive and subtractive manufacturing especially the mesh-based curved fabrication which is composed of **volume decomposition**, **toolpath generation**, and **motion planning** which are fitting for different multi-axis machines, e.g. robot cell and CNC. 

This fundamental structure of this pipeline is built and it is verified by research peers and industry collaborations. Now it is under intensive development and refinement. This pipeline enables the advanced fabrication cell to operate more smartly and efficiently in manufacturing applications. The basic knowledge underpinning my research includes **optimization theory**, **geometric computing and processing**.
