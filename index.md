title: Hi, I'm Tianyu
subtitle: 3D Geometry Processing and Computational Design, Toolpath Planning for Robot-Assisted Manufacturing, Machine learning-based optimization

I am a **postdoctoral researcher** in the Digital Manufacturing Lab at the University of Manchester (**UoM**), where I also earned my PhD in Mechanical Engineering under the supervision of [Prof. Charlie C. L. Wang](https://mewangcl.github.io/) and [Dr. Zekai Murat Kilic](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/zekaimurat.kilic). Prior to that, I completed my Master’s degree at Xi’an Jiaotong University (**XJTU**) and worked at Inovance Technology, Shenzhen. I received my ​B.Eng. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (**UESTC**).

My research lies at the intersection of **3D geometry processing**, **robot-assisted manufacturing**, and **machine learning-enhanced engineering pipelines**. I build robust software systems that transform complex geometric data into scalable, fabrication-aware workflows, especially for multi-axis 3D printing. These pipelines integrate **3D volume decomposition and slicing**, **toolpath generation**, and **kinematics planning**, and are validated through both peer-reviewed research and industrial collaboration.

Technically, I work across **C++**, **Python**, and **ML libraries**, and have experience deploying research code in collaboration with partners such as **Airbus**, **NCC**, and **5AxisMaker**. I’m particularly interested in transforming advanced geometry algorithms into **product-grade, data-driven software tools** that empower design and manufacturing innovation.
